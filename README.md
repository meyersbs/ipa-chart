# IPA Chart

## Description

There are a ridiculous number of International Phonetic Alphabet charts available, all varying in the terminology, arrangement, and style. I'm sick of looking up an IPA chart and finding one that is difficult to use or just plain wrong. I am not a linguist, but this is my attempt to make a succinct, useful, and intuitive IPA chart.
